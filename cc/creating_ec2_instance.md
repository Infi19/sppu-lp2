# Creating an EC2 Instance in AWS

This guide will walk you through the detailed steps to create an Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instance in AWS.

## Prerequisites

- An AWS account
- Basic understanding of cloud computing concepts
- AWS Management Console access

## Step 1: Sign in to the AWS Management Console

1. Open your web browser and go to [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/)
2. Sign in with your AWS account credentials
3. If you're a new user, you may need to create an account first

## Step 2: Navigate to EC2 Service

1. Once logged in, locate the "Services" dropdown at the top of the page
2. Click on "EC2" under the Compute section
3. Alternatively, you can use the search bar at the top and type "EC2"

## Step 3: Launch an EC2 Instance

1. On the EC2 Dashboard, click the orange "Launch instance" button
2. You'll be directed to the instance creation wizard

## Step 4: Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)

1. Select an AMI that suits your needs:
   - Amazon Linux 2 (recommended for beginners)
   - Ubuntu
   - Windows Server
   - Red Hat Enterprise Linux
   - Other options available in the marketplace
2. Pay attention to the "Free tier eligible" tag if you want to avoid charges
3. Click "Select" for your chosen AMI

## Step 5: Choose an Instance Type

1. Select an instance type based on your computing needs:
   - t2.micro is free tier eligible and good for basic testing
   - Other types offer various combinations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity
2. Click "Next: Configure Instance Details" or proceed directly to review if using the new console

## Step 6: Configure Instance Details

1. Configure the following settings (or leave as default for basic setup):
   - Number of instances: 1 (default)
   - Network: Default VPC
   - Subnet: No preference (default)
   - Auto-assign Public IP: Enable
   - IAM role: None (unless you need specific permissions)
   - Shutdown behavior: Stop (default)
   - Enable termination protection: Not checked (default)
2. Click "Next: Add Storage"

## Step 7: Add Storage

1. Configure the root volume:
   - The default size is typically 8GB for most AMIs
   - You can increase this as needed (note that larger volumes may incur charges)
   - Volume type: General Purpose SSD (gp2) is the default
2. Click "Next: Add Tags"

## Step 8: Add Tags (Optional)

1. Click "Add Tag" to create key-value pairs for organizing your instance
2. Common tags include:
   - Name: MyFirstEC2Instance
   - Environment: Development
   - Project: Testing
3. Click "Next: Configure Security Group"

## Step 9: Configure Security Group

1. Create a new security group or select an existing one
2. For a basic setup, allow:
   - SSH (port 22) for Linux instances or RDP (port 3389) for Windows instances
   - Restrict source IP to your IP address for better security
3. Click "Review and Launch"

## Step 10: Review and Launch

1. Review all your instance configurations
2. Click "Launch" when you're satisfied with the settings

## Step 11: Create or Select a Key Pair

1. Select "Create a new key pair" or use an existing one
2. If creating new:
   - Enter a name for your key pair
   - Download the key pair file (.pem)
   - Store it securely (you cannot download it again)
3. Click "Launch Instances"

## Step 12: View Launch Status

1. Click "View Instances" to see your instance being launched
2. Wait for the "Instance State" to change from "pending" to "running"
3. The "Status Checks" will initially show "Initializing" and then change to "2/2 checks passed"

## Step 13: Connect to Your Instance

### For Linux Instances:

1. Select your instance and click "Connect"
2. Follow the instructions to connect via:
   - EC2 Instance Connect (browser-based)
   - SSH client using your key pair
   - EC2 Serial Console

### For Windows Instances:

1. Select your instance and click "Connect"
2. Get the Windows password using your key pair
3. Connect using RDP client

## Step 14: Manage Your Instance

After connecting, you can:
- Install software
- Configure applications
- Set up web servers
- Deploy your code

## Step 15: Monitor Your Instance

1. Use the EC2 Dashboard to monitor:
   - CPU utilization
   - Network traffic
   - Status checks
2. Set up CloudWatch alarms for automated monitoring

## Step 16: Terminate When Done (Important!)

1. When you no longer need the instance, select it in the EC2 Dashboard
2. Click "Instance state" > "Terminate instance"
3. Confirm termination
4. This will stop all charges associated with the instance

## Important Notes

- EC2 instances incur charges when running (unless using free tier eligible instances)
- Always terminate instances you're not using to avoid unexpected charges
- Secure your key pairs and don't share them
- Regularly update your instance's software for security
- Back up important data as terminated instances cannot be recovered

## Next Steps

- Set up Elastic IP for a static public IP address
- Create an AMI of your configured instance for backup
- Implement auto-scaling for handling variable loads
- Use Elastic Load Balancing for distributing traffic

This guide covers the basic process of creating an EC2 instance. AWS frequently updates its console interface, so some steps might vary slightly from what you see.
